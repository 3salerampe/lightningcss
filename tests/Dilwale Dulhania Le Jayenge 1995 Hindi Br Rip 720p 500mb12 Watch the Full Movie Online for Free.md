The film begins with a flashback of Baldev Singh (Amrish Puri), a young man who leaves his village in Punjab, India, for London, England. He promises his mother that he will always uphold their traditions and values. Years later, he runs a convenience store and lives with his wife Lajwanti (Farida Jalal) and his daughters Simran (Kajol) and Chutki (Pooja Ruparel). Simran is a dreamy and romantic girl who yearns for true love. She writes a letter to her mother expressing her feelings, which is read by her father, who becomes angry and reminds her of her arranged marriage to his friend's son Kuljeet (Parmeet Sethi) in Punjab.
 
Meanwhile, Raj Malhotra (Shah Rukh Khan) is a carefree and wealthy young man who lives with his father Dharamvir (Anupam Kher) in London. He is a prankster and a flirt who does not believe in love or marriage. He fails his final year exams at college and is given another chance by his father, who also allows him to go on a month-long vacation to Europe with his friends. On the trip, he meets Simran, who is also travelling with her friends. They initially dislike each other, but gradually fall in love after a series of adventures. They part ways at the end of the trip, with Raj promising to come back for Simran.
 
Simran returns home and tells her mother about Raj, but her father overhears their conversation and decides to leave for India immediately with his family. Raj arrives at Simran's house the next day, only to find out that they have left. He then learns from his father that Simran's father had called him and angrily told him about Raj's affair with Simran. Dharamvir encourages Raj to go after Simran and win her back. Raj agrees and travels to India with his friend Preeti (Mandira Bedi).
