Introducing Esko Studio, a 3D packaging design and visualization software that works seamlessly with Adobe Illustrator. With Studio, you can design labels in 3D to perfectly fit any structural packaging design. You can also try different materials, finishes, and effects to achieve the best look for your brand. And you can create stunning 3D images and animations in minutes, without leaving Illustrator.
 
## Why Use Esko Studio for 3D Packaging Design?
 
Esko Studio is not just another 3D software tool. It is a solution that is specifically designed for packaging design and production. Here are some of the benefits of using Studio for your 3D packaging projects:
 
- It is fast and easy. You don't need any special 3D skills to use Studio. You can simply import your existing Illustrator artwork and apply it to a 3D shape from the Studio library or your own custom shape. You can also use plugins for Illustrator to access Studio features directly from your familiar interface.
- It is accurate and realistic. Studio uses patented print modeling technology that uses the actual production assets, such as substrates, inks, varnishes, foils, and holograms. This ensures that your 3D models and images are in sync with the printed packaging, creating a digital twin. You can also use Studio's ray tracing feature to produce photorealistic rendering that looks like an actual photograph.
- It is innovative and collaborative. Studio enables you to design more concepts in a fraction of the time and experiment with different options. You can also share your 3D models and images with your clients, colleagues, and suppliers using PDF files, movies, or interactive web pages. This way, you can enhance decision-making, communicate design intent, and get faster feedback.
