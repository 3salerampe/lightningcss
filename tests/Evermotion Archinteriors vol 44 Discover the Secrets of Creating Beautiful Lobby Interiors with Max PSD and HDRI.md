According to experts, some of the trends that will dominate in 2023 are earth tones, especially browns and pinks, silver accents, formal details, and neo-brutalism.
 
Earth tones are soothing and natural, perfect for creating a relaxing and inviting atmosphere in any lobby. Browns are versatile and can be paired with different colors and textures, while pinks add a touch of warmth and romance. Silver accents, on the other hand, bring a touch of elegance and sophistication to any space. They can be used for lighting fixtures, furniture details, or accessories.

Formal details are also making a comeback, as people crave more refinement and structure after spending so much time at home. Think classic moldings, columns, arches, and chandeliers. These elements can add character and charm to any lobby, without being too stuffy or pretentious.
 
Neo-brutalism is another trend that is gaining popularity among interior designers. It is inspired by the brutalist architecture of the mid-20th century, which featured raw concrete, geometric shapes, and minimal ornamentation. However, neo-brutalism is not as harsh or cold as its predecessor. It incorporates warmer touches, such as wood, plants, or textiles, to balance out the industrial vibe.
 
Archinteriors vol 44 showcases how these trends can be applied to different lobby styles and settings. Whether you prefer a modern and minimalist look, a cozy and rustic feel, or a glamorous and luxurious ambiance, you can find a scene that suits your taste and vision. You can also mix and match different elements from different scenes to create your own unique design.
