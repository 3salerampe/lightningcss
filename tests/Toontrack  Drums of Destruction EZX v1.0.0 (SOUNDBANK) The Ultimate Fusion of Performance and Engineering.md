The Drums of Destruction EZX was recorded at Hybrid Studios in Orange County, CA, a state-of-the-art facility with a perfectly treated live room that captures the drums with clarity and punch. The library was engineered and produced by Josh Wilbur, who has worked with some of the biggest names in metal such as Lamb of God, Megadeth, Korn and Gojira. He also sampled Chris Adler's performance, giving you access to his unique style and groove.
 
The library comes with 14 mix-ready presets that showcase the different sounds and possibilities of the kits. You can also use the five custom "No bus FX" presets that are designed for multi-out purposes if you want more control over the individual channels. Moreover, you get a selection of MIDI grooves inspired by Lamb of God songs, performed by Chris Adler himself.
 
The Drums of Destruction EZX is a great choice for anyone who wants to add some heavy and aggressive drums to their metal tracks. The kits sound huge and realistic, with plenty of dynamics and articulations. The presets are well-balanced and easy to use, but you can also tweak them to your liking with the built-in effects and mixer. The MIDI grooves are tight and inspiring, covering a range of tempos and styles.

## The Mapex Versatus Prototype Kit
 
This is the personal kit of Chris Adler, who is known for his powerful and technical drumming with Lamb of God. He used this kit on their latest album, *Lamb of God*, which was released in 2020. The kit consists of a 22" x 18" kick, a 10" x 7" rack tom, a 12" x 8" rack tom, a 16" x 14" floor tom, a 14" x 6.5" snare and a 13" x 6.5" snare. The cymbals are a mix of Meinl and Sabian, including a 14" hi-hat, a 16" crash, an 18" crash, a 20" ride, an 18" china and a 10" splash.
 
The Mapex kit has a bright and punchy sound, with a lot of attack and sustain. The kick is deep and solid, with a nice click and boom. The toms are warm and resonant, with a clear pitch and tone. The snares are crisp and snappy, with a good balance between body and ring. The cymbals are bright and cutting, with a lot of shimmer and wash.
 
The Mapex kit is ideal for modern metal styles that require fast and precise drumming, such as thrash metal, groove metal or metalcore. It can also work well for progressive metal or djent, as it has a lot of clarity and definition. The Mapex kit comes with six presets that showcase its versatility: "Adler's Kit", "Adler's Kit (No Bus FX)", "Adler's Kit (Processed)", "Adler's Kit (Processed) (No Bus FX)", "Adler's Kit (Raw)" and "Adler's Kit (Raw) (No Bus FX)".
 
## The Pearl Reference Kit
 
This is the kit that Josh Wilbur handpicked for several of his productions, such as Gojira's *Magma* or Korn's *The Serenity of Suffering*. It is a Pearl Reference kit that features a 22" x 18" kick, a 10" x 8" rack tom, a 12" x 9" rack tom, a 14" x 14" floor tom, a 16" x 16" floor tom and a 14" x 6.5" snare. The cymbals are all Zildjian, including a 15" hi-hat, an 18" crash, a 19" crash, a 20" ride, an 18" china and an 8" splash.
 
The Pearl kit has a dark and fat sound, with a lot of body and warmth. The kick is thick and punchy, with a smooth low end and midrange. The toms are deep and rich, with a lot of sustain and tone. The snare is fat and full, with a nice crack and snap. The cymbals are dark and smooth, with a lot of character and decay.
 
The Pearl kit is ideal for classic metal styles that require heavy and groovy drumming, such as doom metal, stoner metal or sludge metal. It can also work well for alternative metal or nu metal, as it has a lot of weight and presence. The Pearl kit comes with six presets that showcase its different sounds: "Wilbur's Kit", "Wilbur's Kit (No Bus FX)", "Wilbur's Kit (Processed)", "Wilbur's Kit (Processed) (No Bus FX)", "Wilbur's Kit (Raw)" and "Wilbur's Kit (Raw) (No Bus FX)".
