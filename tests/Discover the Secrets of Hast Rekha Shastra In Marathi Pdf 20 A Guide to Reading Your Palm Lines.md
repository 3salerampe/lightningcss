## How to Read Your Palm
 
Before you begin reading your palm, you need to know which hand to look at. According to Hast Rekha Shastra, the right hand represents the active or dominant side of a person, while the left hand represents the passive or subconscious side. The right hand shows what a person has achieved or will achieve in life, while the left hand shows what a person was born with or inherited. Therefore, for most people, the right hand is more important for palm reading than the left hand.
 
However, some palmists also consider the gender of the person when choosing which hand to read. For men, they may look at the right hand for their career and public life, and the left hand for their personal and emotional life. For women, they may look at the left hand for their career and public life, and the right hand for their personal and emotional life. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide which hand is more relevant for your situation.

Once you have chosen which hand to read, you need to observe its general characteristics. The shape of the palm, the length and width of the fingers, the size and shape of the nails, and the color and texture of the skin can all reveal something about your personality and temperament. For example, a square palm indicates a practical and realistic nature, a long finger indicates an analytical and intellectual mind, a round nail indicates a gentle and artistic temperament, and a pink skin indicates a healthy and energetic body.
 
### The Major Lines
 
The most important part of palm reading is studying the major lines that run across the palm. These are the life line, the head line, the heart line, and the fate line. Each line has its own meaning and significance for your life.
 
- The life line: This is the curved line that starts from the edge of the palm between the thumb and index finger, and ends near the wrist. It represents your vitality, longevity, health, and major life events. A long and deep life line indicates a strong constitution and a smooth life. A short and shallow life line indicates a weak constitution and a troubled life. A broken or chained life line indicates obstacles or accidents in life.
- The head line: This is the horizontal line that starts from the edge of the palm below the index finger, and runs across the middle of the palm. It represents your intelligence, mentality, wisdom, and attitude. A long and straight head line indicates a clear and logical mind. A short and curved head line indicates a creative and intuitive mind. A broken or forked head line indicates confusion or indecision in life.
- The heart line: This is the horizontal line that starts from the edge of the palm below the little finger, and runs across the upper part of the palm. It represents your emotions, feelings, relationships, and love life. A long and deep heart line indicates a passionate and loyal nature. A short and shallow heart line indicates a cold and detached nature. A broken or chained heart line indicates difficulties or betrayals in love.
- The fate line: This is the vertical line that starts from the base of the palm near the wrist, and runs up towards the middle finger. It represents your career, success, fortune, and destiny. A long and straight fate line indicates a steady and prosperous career. A short and wavy fate line indicates an unstable or changing career. A broken or missing fate line indicates a lack of direction or purpose in life 8cf37b1e13
