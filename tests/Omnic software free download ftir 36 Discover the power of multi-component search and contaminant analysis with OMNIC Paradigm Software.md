# OMNIC Software: A Powerful Tool for FTIR Data Analysis
 
OMNIC Software is a comprehensive software package for Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy that allows you to perform a wide range of tasks, from collecting infrared spectra to performing quantitative analysis. Whether you are doing time-based experiments such as TGA-IR, GC-IR, SPR and FT-IR and Raman kinetics studies, or simply identifying material components from a selected FT-IR or Raman spectrum, OMNIC Software can help you extract the hidden chemical information in your data.
 
In this article, we will introduce some of the features and benefits of OMNIC Software, and show you how to download it for free.

## Features and Benefits of OMNIC Software
 
OMNIC Software is designed to make your FTIR data analysis easy and efficient. Some of the features and benefits of OMNIC Software are:
 
- **Data collection and visualization:** OMNIC Software lets you configure the experimental conditions and collect spectra using Thermo Scientific Nicolet FT-IR instruments. You can also view your data in various 2D and 3D display options, such as spectra, overlays, maps, profiles, contours, etc.
- **Data processing and analysis:** OMNIC Software gives you access to a wide range of data processing and analysis functions, such as baseline correction, smoothing, normalization, peak picking, integration, derivative, subtraction, etc. You can also perform calculations on whole time-series or just an individual time profile or spectrum.
- **Data extraction and interpretation:** OMNIC Software enables you to create multiple user-defined time profiles during real-time data collection and in post-collection reprocessing using a number of calculation methods such as Gram-Schmidt Reconstruction (GSR), chemigram, peak area or height and Thermo Scientific TQ Analyst Software quantitation methods. You can also use the one-click spectral search feature combined with the extensive spectral libraries collections to identify material components from a selected FT-IR or Raman spectrum within the data set.
- **Data export and report:** OMNIC Software allows you to export your data in various formats such as ASCII, JCAMP-DX, SPC, etc. You can also generate customized reports with graphs, tables and text using the report editor.
