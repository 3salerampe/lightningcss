The novel is divided into three parts, corresponding to the three stages of Ania's transformation: larva, pupa and imago. In the first part, Ania is a normal teenage girl, living with her parents and brother in a small town. She has a crush on a boy named Tomek, who is also interested in her. One day, she goes to a nearby forest with Tomek and his friends, where they encounter a strange insect that bites Ania. Ania soon starts to feel sick and develops a fever. She also notices that her body is changing: her skin becomes hard and scaly, her hair falls out, and her eyes turn red.
 
In the second part, Ania is confined to her room, where she wraps herself in a cocoon-like substance. She becomes isolated from her family and friends, who are afraid and disgusted by her condition. She also loses contact with Tomek, who is pressured by his parents to stay away from her. Ania spends most of her time sleeping and dreaming, in which she sees visions of her past, present and future. She also hears voices that speak to her in different languages and reveal secrets about herself and the world. She learns that she is not the only poczwarka in existence, and that there is a purpose for her transformation.

In the third part, Ania emerges from her cocoon as a beautiful winged creature, resembling an angel. She feels free and happy, but also lonely and misunderstood. She decides to leave her home and fly away, in search of other poczwarkas like her. She also hopes to find Tomek again, who has been searching for her all this time. However, she faces many dangers and obstacles along the way, such as hunters, predators and fanatics. She also discovers that her transformation has a price: she has a limited lifespan and will soon die.
