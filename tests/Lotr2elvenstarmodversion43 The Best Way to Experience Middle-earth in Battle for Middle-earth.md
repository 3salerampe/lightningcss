The mod was created by a user named Marhelm, who posted it on the Xiaomi Community forum[^1^]. The mod received positive feedback from other users, who praised its creativity and humor. Marhelm also shared a link to download the mod's crack file[^1^], which allows users to play the mod without purchasing the original game. However, some users reported that the link was broken or infected with malware.
 
If you are a fan of Troll Face Quest Video Games 2 and Lord of the Rings, you might want to check out Lotr2elvenstarmodversion43. However, be careful where you download it from, as it might not be safe or legal. Alternatively, you can play the original game from Rockstar Games[^5^] [^6^], which offers many other fun and funny levels to troll your way through.

Lotr2elvenstarmodversion43 is not the only game mod that Marhelm has created. He also posted links to other mods on the Xiaomi Community forum, such as GTA5elvenstarmodversion43, Minecraftelvenstarmodversion43, and Fortniteelvenstarmodversion43. These mods also add Lord of the Rings elements to other popular video games, such as Grand Theft Auto V, Minecraft, and Fortnite. However, these mods have not received as much attention or feedback as Lotr2elvenstarmodversion43.
 
Marhelm seems to be obsessed with Lord of the Rings and elven stars, which are symbols of the elves in the fantasy world. He often uses them in his username, profile picture, and mod titles. He also claims to be an elf himself, and says that he is not alone. He says that he has a group of friends who share his passion for Lord of the Rings and elven stars, and that they are planning to make more mods in the future.
 
However, some users have questioned Marhelm's motives and credibility. They suspect that he is using the mods as a way to spread malware or steal personal information from unsuspecting gamers. They also doubt that he has any friends or followers, and that he is just a lonely troll who is seeking attention and fame. They advise other users to avoid downloading his mods or interacting with him.

Lotr2elvenstarmodversion43 is a game mod that has sparked curiosity and controversy among gamers and Lord of the Rings fans. Some find it amusing and creative, while others find it annoying and suspicious. Marhelm, the creator of the mod, seems to have a mysterious and eccentric personality, and his intentions are unclear. He claims to be an elf who loves Lord of the Rings and elven stars, and who wants to share his passion with others. However, he also seems to be a troll who enjoys making fun of other games and gamers, and who might have ulterior motives for his mods.
