## How to Use SolidCAM 2013 64bit 94
 
SolidCAM 2013 64bit 94 is a user-friendly and versatile CAM software that allows you to create and edit CNC programs for various machines and applications. You can use SolidCAM as a standalone application or as an integrated add-in for SolidWorks. In this section, we will give you a brief overview of how to use SolidCAM 2013 64bit 94.

- To start a new project, you can either create a new part in SolidCAM or import an existing part from SolidWorks or another CAD software. You can also open a sample part from the SolidCAM library.
- To define the machining parameters, you need to create a coordinate system, select a machine and a tool table, and define the stock material and dimensions. You can also set the work offset and the origin of the coordinate system.
- To create a machining operation, you need to select a tool from the tool table, choose a strategy from the operation type list, and define the geometry and the parameters of the operation. You can also use the iMachining technology wizard to automatically generate optimal cutting conditions based on your tool, material, and machine capabilities.
- To simulate and verify the machining process, you can use the SolidVerify or Machine Simulation modules. You can view the toolpath, the stock removal, the collisions, and the machining time. You can also edit and optimize the toolpath using the G-Code editor or the Toolpath Manager.
- To generate the CNC code, you need to select a postprocessor from the postprocessor list and save the output file. You can also customize the postprocessor settings and edit the output file using the G-Code editor.
