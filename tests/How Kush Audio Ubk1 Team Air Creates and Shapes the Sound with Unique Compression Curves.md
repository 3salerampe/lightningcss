Kush Audio UBK1 is a compressor plug-in that offers five different compression curves and a unique interface that lets you adjust the movement and groove of a sound. Unlike conventional compressors, UBK1 does not have attack, release, or ratio controls. Instead, it has a density knob that changes the shape of the compression curve, a saturation knob that adds harmonic distortion, and a mix knob that blends the dry and wet signals. UBK1 also has three different headroom settings that affect the overall tone and character of the compression.

UBK1 is designed to create and enhance the musicality and vibe of a sound, rather than just control its dynamics. It can be used on drums, bass, vocals, guitars, synths, and more. UBK1 can produce subtle smoothing, punchy squashing, or extreme pumping effects. It can also add warmth, grit, and glue to a mix. UBK1 is a versatile and creative tool that can give your tracks a distinctive sound.
 
UBK1 is available as a VST, AU, AAX, and RTAS plug-in for Windows and Mac. It costs $149 and can be purchased from Kush Audio's website[^1^]. You can also download a free trial version to test it out before buying. UBK1 has received positive reviews from users and critics alike. Sound On Sound magazine praised its sound quality and ease of use, but noted that it lacks a side-chain input[^2^]. If you are looking for a compressor that can do more than just level your tracks, you might want to check out UBK1.

To demonstrate how UBK1 works, let's try it on a drum loop. First, we load the plug-in on the drum track and select the 'Smooth' curve. This curve is the most gentle and transparent of the five, and it can be used to tame the peaks and even out the dynamics. We set the density knob to about 50%, which gives us a moderate amount of compression. We can see the gain reduction meter showing how much the signal is being compressed. We also increase the saturation knob to about 20%, which adds some subtle harmonic enhancement to the drums. We leave the mix knob at 100%, which means we are hearing only the wet signal.
 
Now, let's switch to the 'Squishy' curve. This curve is more aggressive and colorful than the 'Smooth' one, and it can be used to create a punchy and fat sound. We lower the density knob to about 30%, which gives us a more pronounced compression effect. We can hear how the drums are being squashed and pushed forward in the mix. We also increase the saturation knob to about 40%, which adds some more distortion and grit to the drums. We lower the mix knob to about 80%, which means we are hearing a blend of the dry and wet signals. This creates a parallel compression effect that preserves some of the original dynamics while adding some extra weight and energy.
 
Finally, let's try the 'Pumpy' curve. This curve is the most extreme and dramatic of the five, and it can be used to create a rhythmic and pulsing sound. We increase the density knob to about 70%, which gives us a very heavy compression effect. We can see how the gain reduction meter is bouncing in sync with the drums. We can also hear how the drums are breathing and pumping with the music. We lower the saturation knob to about 10%, which reduces some of the distortion and makes the sound cleaner. We increase the mix knob to about 90%, which means we are hearing mostly the wet signal.
 
As you can see, UBK1 can transform a drum loop in different ways by changing just a few parameters. You can experiment with different curves, settings, and headroom modes to find the best sound for your track. UBK1 is not only a compressor, but also a creative tool that can shape and enhance your sound.
