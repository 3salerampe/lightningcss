> "The Glue is a fantastic compressor plugin that emulates the SSL sound very well. It has a very warm and punchy sound that works great on drums, vocals, guitars, and more. It also has some extra features that make it more versatile and flexible than the original hardware. The peak clipper is very handy for adding some subtle distortion and limiting to the signal. The mix knob is great for parallel compression and blending the dry and wet signals. The range knob is awesome for limiting the amount of compression applied and keeping some natural dynamics."
