Windows 7 is a popular operating system that many people still use today. However, it does not fully support UEFI, which is a modern firmware interface for computers. UEFI offers faster boot times, better security, and more features than the legacy BIOS. However, Windows 7 relies on BIOS interrupt 10 (Int10h) during initial graphics initialization, which is not available on UEFI Class 3 systems. This means that Windows 7 might freeze on the 'Starting Windows' screen or fail with error code 0xc000000d when trying to boot on such systems.

Fortunately, there is a solution for this problem. UefiSeven is an EFI loader that emulates Int10h interrupts needed for booting Windows 7 under UEFI Class 3 systems[^1^]. It also contains a hack to enable screen output on hardwares that do not natively support 1024x768 resolution, which is required by Windows Installer. UefiSeven can be used to install and run Windows 7 on computers without proper legacy support, such as some laptops and tablets.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use UefiSeven to boot Windows 7 under UEFI Class 3 systems. You will need a Windows 7 installation USB drive and an EFI shell to copy files. You will also need to disable antivirus software and computer firewalls before using UefiSeven, as they might interfere with its work.
 
## Step 1: Prepare Windows 7 Installation USB Drive
 
1. Rename `bootx64.efi` at `(UsbDrive)\EFI\Boot\` to `bootx64.original.efi`
2. Download UefiSeven from [https://github.com/manatails/uefiseven](https://github.com/manatails/uefiseven) and extract it
3. Copy `bootx64.efi` from UefiSeven archive to `(UsbDrive)\EFI\Boot\`

## Step 2: Install Windows 7

1. Boot from the USB drive and follow the installation instructions
2. Finish the initial installation and wait for the reboot prompt
3. Power off the computer

## Step 3: Copy UefiSeven to HDD

1. Boot from the EFI shell (you might need another USB drive for this)
2. Rename `bootmgfw.efi` at `(HDD)\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\` to `bootmgfw.original.efi`
3. Copy UefiSeven `bootx64.efi` to `(HDD)\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi`
4. Reboot the computer and enjoy Windows 7 under UEFI Class 3 systems!

You can also apply some settings by placing `UefiSeven.ini` file in the directory containing the main efi file. Refer to the sample configuration file for available options[^1^]. If you encounter any problems or have any questions, you can visit the GitHub page of UefiSeven or contact the developer.

## Step 4: Activate Windows 7
 
After installing and running Windows 7 under UEFI Class 3 systems, you might notice that your copy of Windows 7 is not activated. This means that you will not be able to receive updates and have a fully secure and up-to-date operating system. You will also see a watermark on the bottom right corner of your screen and a notification asking you to activate Windows.
 
To activate Windows 7, you will need a valid licence key or a crack tool. A licence key is a 25-character code that proves that you own a genuine copy of Windows 7. You can buy a licence key from Microsoft or other authorized sellers, or use the one that came with your computer or installation disc. To enter the licence key, go to Start > Control Panel > System and Security > System and click on Activate Windows. Then, type in your licence key and follow the instructions.
 
If you do not have a licence key or do not want to buy one, you can use a crack tool to bypass the activation process. A crack tool is a software that modifies the system files or registry entries of Windows 7 to make it think that it is activated. However, using a crack tool is illegal and risky, as it might contain malware or damage your system. You should also be careful about where you download the crack tool from, as some websites might offer fake or harmful downloads.
 
One of the most popular and reliable crack tools for Windows 7 is Windows Loader by Daz. It is compatible with all versions of Windows 7 and supports both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. It also works with UEFI Class 3 systems and does not interfere with UefiSeven. To use Windows Loader by Daz, follow these steps:

1. Download Windows Loader by Daz from [https://www.yasir252.com/en/apps/download-windows-7-loader-daz-activator/](https://www.yasir252.com/en/apps/download-windows-7-loader-daz-activator/) and extract it
2. Run the .exe file with Run as administrator
3. Press the Install button and wait until the process is complete
4. Reboot the computer and check the activation status

You should now see that your copy of Windows 7 is activated and genuine. You can receive updates and have a fully secure and up-to-date operating system. You can also remove the watermark and notification by going to Start > Control Panel > System and Security > System and clicking on Remove Watermark.
