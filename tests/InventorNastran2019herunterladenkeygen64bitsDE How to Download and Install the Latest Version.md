Firangi is not just a comedy film, but also a historical drama that depicts the struggle of the Indian people against the British colonialism. The film shows how Manga, who initially works for the British, gradually realizes the injustice and oppression faced by his fellow countrymen. He then decides to join the freedom movement and fight for his village and his love. The film also portrays the cultural and social aspects of the pre-independence era, such as the caste system, the rural life and the folk music.
 
The film's title Firangi means "foreigner" in Hindi, and it refers to both the British and Manga. The British are called Firangi by the Indians as a derogatory term, while Manga is called Firangi by his villagers as a nickname because of his ability to cure people's back pain by kicking them. The film also uses the word Firangi as a metaphor for the clash of cultures and ideologies between the Indians and the British.
 
The film's music was composed by Jatinder Shah and featured songs sung by popular singers such as Sunidhi Chauhan, Daler Mehndi, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Shafqat Amanat Ali. The film's soundtrack received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. Some of the popular songs from the film are "Oye Firangi", "Sajna Sohne Jiha", "Tu Jit Jawna" and "Gulbadan".
  
Firangi was Kapil Sharma's second film as a lead actor after his debut in Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon (2015). He also co-produced the film under his banner K9 Films.

He learned to ride a horse, speak in a Punjabi accent and wear a turban. He also lost 15 kg of weight for the film.
 
The film also marked the Bollywood debut of Ishita Dutta, who played the female lead Sargi. Dutta is the younger sister of actress Tanushree Dutta, who is known for her role in Aashiq Banaya Aapne (2005). Dutta had previously worked in television shows and Telugu films. She was praised for her performance and chemistry with Sharma in the film. The film also featured Monica Gill as Princess Shyamali Devi, a British-Indian woman who falls in love with Manga. Gill is a former Miss India Worldwide and has worked in Punjabi films.
 
The film also had a supporting cast of veteran actors such as Kumud Mishra, Rajesh Sharma, Inaamulhaq, Aanjjan Srivastav and Jameel Khan.
