- Use the best fishing rod and gear you can find or craft. They will increase your fishing skill and make it easier to catch fish in higher-level zones. You can also use fishing lures, baits, and potions to boost your skill temporarily.
- Learn the fishing patterns of each zone. Different fish can be found in different types of water, such as fresh water, salt water, inland water, coastal water, etc. Some fish are also exclusive to certain regions, such as Outland, Northrend, Pandaria, etc. You can use the fishing journal UI to see where each fish can be found.
- Look for fishing pools. These are circular spots on the water surface that indicate a higher concentration of fish. Fishing from pools will guarantee a catch of that type of fish and increase your chances of getting rare items. Pools can spawn randomly or be created by using Iskaaran Fishing Net s or Iskaaran Harpoon s.
- Complete fishing quests and achievements. These will reward you with experience, gold, reputation, and sometimes unique items or mounts. You can find fishing quests from various NPCs around the world, such as Nat Pagle , Marcia Chase , or The Great Swog . You can also check your achievement tab for fishing-related goals.
- Join a fishing guild or community. Fishing can be more fun and rewarding when you do it with other players who share your passion. You can chat, trade, compete, and cooperate with fellow fishers. You can also learn from their experience and tips.

Fishing is a relaxing and profitable activity in World of Warcraft. Whether you do it for fun, for food, or for gold, you will find plenty of opportunities and challenges in the Dragon Isles and beyond. Happy fishing!
