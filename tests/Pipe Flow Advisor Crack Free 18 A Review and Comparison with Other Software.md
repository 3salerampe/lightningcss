# How to Download Pipe Flow Advisor Software for Free
 
Pipe Flow Advisor is a software that can help you model and calculate the flow of water in open channels, pipes, and tanks. It can also estimate the time taken for a tank to empty with gravity flow, and the volume and weight of water in different containers. Pipe Flow Advisor is based on the Manning formula, which is an empirical formula for estimating the flow rate of water in free-surface flow driven by gravity.

How does Pipe Flow Advisor work? Pipe Flow Advisor uses the Manning formula to estimate the flow rate of water in open channels and part-filled pipes. The Manning formula takes into account the cross-sectional area of the flow, the wetted perimeter, the slope ratio, and the Manning coefficient. The Manning coefficient is a factor that depends on the type and roughness of the channel. Pipe Flow Advisor has a database of Manning coefficients for different materials and shapes of channels. You can also enter your own value if you know it.

Pipe Flow Advisor also uses the Bernoulli equation and the Torricelli equation to estimate the flow rate from a tank outlet. The Bernoulli equation relates the pressure, velocity, and height of a fluid at two points along a streamline. The Torricelli equation is a special case of the Bernoulli equation that applies to a fluid exiting a tank through a small hole. Pipe Flow Advisor can calculate the flow rate from a tank for different shapes of tanks and outlets, such as circular, rectangular, elliptical, conical, and triangular.
 
Pipe Flow Advisor can also calculate the volume and weight of water in different containers, such as channels, pipes, tanks, and weirs. It can also calculate the time taken for a tank to empty with gravity flow. You can enter the dimensions and shape of the container, and Pipe Flow Advisor will display the results in various units of measurement. You can also export the results to a text file or print them out.
