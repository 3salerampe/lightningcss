## Subway Surfers Tips and Tricks
 
If you want to improve your skills and score higher in Subway Surfers, you might want to check out some of these tips and tricks that can help you become a pro.

- Use power-ups wisely: There are several power-ups available in the game, such as the Super Sneakers, Jetpack, and Coin Magnet. They can give you an edge and help you collect more coins and avoid obstacles. However, they also have some drawbacks. For example, the Super Sneakers can make you jump too high and miss some coins or power-ups. The Jetpack can make you miss some of the letters for the Word Hunt. The Coin Magnet can attract coins from both lanes, which can be risky if there are trains or barriers. Therefore, you should use power-ups strategically and not rely on them too much.
- Keep an eye out for obstacles: Be on the lookout for obstacles such as trains, barriers, and other hazards that can slow you down or end your run. You should also pay attention to the signs that indicate the direction of the trains or the upcoming obstacles. Sometimes, it is better to stay on the ground than to jump on the trains or rooftops, as there might be more obstacles there. You should also avoid swiping too fast or too often, as you might lose control and crash into something.
- Collect coins and keys: Collect as many coins as possible to purchase upgrades and power-ups from the shop. You can also use coins to unlock new characters and boards. Keys are also very important, as they can help you revive yourself after crashing. You can find keys on the tracks or in mystery boxes. You can also get keys by completing missions or watching ads.
- Complete missions and season hunts: Missions are tasks that you have to complete during your runs, such as collecting a certain number of coins, power-ups, or letters. Completing missions will increase your multiplier, which will boost your score. Season hunts are special events that happen every month, where you have to collect tokens related to a theme or a location. Collecting tokens will reward you with prizes such as coins, keys, characters, boards, or outfits.
- Upgrade your power-ups: You can upgrade your power-ups from the shop using coins. Upgrading your power-ups will increase their duration and effectiveness. For example, upgrading your Jetpack will make it last longer and fly higher. Upgrading your Coin Magnet will make it attract more coins from a wider range. Upgrading your 2X Multiplier will double your score for a longer time.

With these tips and tricks, you can master Subway Surfers and set new records on the leaderboard. Have fun!
